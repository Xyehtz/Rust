# Hello there

Hello traveler, I hope this repo finds you well.

This is my first self learning repo that you will find on my profile, it's all about Rust, and also some git and github configurations that I want to put in practice.

If you are here very early I'm sure that you won't find anything relevant, but, I hope that with some time you will start to find some new and interesting things.

Right now, this is all I have to say, please check the [learning objectives checklist to see my progress](Learning%20Objectives.md).
